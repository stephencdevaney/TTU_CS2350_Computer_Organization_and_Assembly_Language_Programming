Program practices: write a program for each question. We need to finish them after chapter 4.

Project 1:
Description: Write a program that uses a loop to calculate the first
seven values in the Fibonacci number sequence { 1,1,2,3,5,8,13 }.
Place each value in the EAX register and display it with a
call DumpRegs statement inside the loop.

Project 2: 
Description: Write a program using the LOOP instruction with
indirect addressing that copies a string from source to target,
reversing the character order in the process. Display both the source and the target in the memory.

Project 3:
Use a loop with indirect or indexed addressing to reverse the elements of an 
integer array in place. Do not copy the elements to any other array. Use the 
SIZEOF, TYPE, and LENGTHOF operators to make the program as flexible as possible 
if the array size and type should be changed in the future. Optionally, you 
may display the modified array by calling the DumpMem method from the Irvine32 
library.
